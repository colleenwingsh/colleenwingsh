MIT CS + AI at the Schwarzman College of Computing. Research, engineering, entrepreneurship, and campus governance all running in parallel. I build models, ship software, lead orgs, and keep every club because the constraint is time, not ambition. Institute infrastructure meets compulsion to optimize.

Studying how systems learn, coordinate, and scale — from neural networks to student organizations and technical communities. Intelligence as engineering problem, leadership as systems design, extracurriculars as distributed compute. MIT is the cluster; Schwarzman provides the compute.

Stack: python, pytorch, jax, cuda, c/c++, rust, sql, unix, git, distributed systems, deep learning, mlops, cloud, product, leadership, operations, strategy, community building, research

Reverse-engineering institutions and intelligent systems to see how capability organizes — and why it refuses to drop any task it can still optimize.
