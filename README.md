CS + AI at the Schwarzman College of Computing. I work across research, engineering, entrepreneurship, and student leadership — moving between labs, orgs, and product rooms like parallel threads in a larger computation. I don’t drop clubs; I pipeline them.

I study how intelligence emerges and how communities scale — neural networks, student organizations, and technical ecosystems all rhyme in their coordination patterns. Intelligence as architecture; leadership as systems design; ambition as distributed compute. MIT handles the infrastructure; Schwarzman handles the throughput.

Stack: python, pytorch, jax, cuda, c/c++, rust, sql, unix, git, distributed systems, deep learning, mlops, cloud, product, strategy, operations, organizational design, community building, research

Reverse-engineering institutions and intelligent systems to understand how capability organizes — and how it compounds when nothing is dropped.
